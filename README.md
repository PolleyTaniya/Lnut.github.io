## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm Taniya!  
I'm a student studying Statistics, passionate about Machine learinig.  
Iâ€™ve recently completed the **AI Programming with Python Nanodegree** from Udacity and Iâ€™m working on projects that mix creativity with code.

This GitHub is where I share what Iâ€™m learning, building, and exploring.
